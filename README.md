# account-info-api-spec


# Version
This is version v1.1.1  
A Patch Release

## Change Control
Change since v1.1.0
* Remove `tpp_client_credential` scope and replace with `accounts` scope

# Usage (new approach)

To generate swagger from data definition CSV, and then create swagger
file from inputs/v* run:

```sh
npm run csvtoyaml && npm run buildswagger
```

Resulting swagger files are written to dist/v*.


# Usage (old approach)
```npm run start```  builds the project and runs a local webserver on http://localhost:8080/ serving the swagger spec using the spectacles-docs format

# Scripts
```npm run test``` runs the tests , validate swagger spec against the swagger schema (not the editor!!)

```npm run flatten-schemas``` flattens the schemas in the schema folder<br>
```npm run compile-swagger``` dereference the swagger spec split from  several yaml files to one fully dereferenced yaml file , dereferencing the schemas compiled using npm run flatten-schemas

# Debugging

When runnning ```npm run build:all``` the schema flattening was failing
 due to multiple referenced files not being interpreted correctly.
It's now possible to see a debug log of the inner reference fixes
set the environment variable *SWAGGER_DEBUG=true* and a json file of old / fixes / and fixed
partials will appear in the path *debug/log.json*

# Versions
The buid scripts depend on a version being set in an environment variable
e.g. export `VERSION=v1.0`  
The Master list of allowable versions is stored in the /build/versions.js file
and must be maintained there as new versions are created.


**** WIP Documentation ****
To convert SwaggerSpec to MARKDOWN
You need to have
1) swagger2markup-cli-1.3.1.jar  -> http://swagger2markup.github.io/swagger2markup/1.3.1/#_command_line_interface

Install Ruby and PDF libraries.
Either:
- rbenv install 2.2.9
- gem install bundler
- bundle install
OR:
- rvm install 2.2
- rvm use 2.2
- gem install asciidoctor
- gem install --pre asciidoctor-pdf
- gem uninstall prawn
- gem install prawn -v 2.1.0

# Troubleshooting

If you run `npm run build:all` and there are errors in a new terminal session,
issuing the command `rvm use 2.2` may fix it
