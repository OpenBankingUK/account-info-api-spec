                      to provide an additional means of identification of the
                      account.

                      Usage: The account name is different from the account
                      owner name. The account name is used in certain user
                      communities to provide a means of identifying the account,
                      in addition to the account owner's identity and the
                      account number.

                      This is secondary identification of the account, as

                      This can be used by building societies to additionally
                      identify accounts with a roll number (in addition to a

          reference in the structured remittance information, to enable
          reconciliation by the creditor upon receipt of the amount of money.

          If the business context requires the use of a creditor reference or a
          payment remit identification, and only one identifier can be passed
          through the end-to-end chain, the creditor's reference or payment
          remittance identification should be quoted in the end-to-end

              have common needs and respond similarly to a marketing action.
              Market segmentation enables companies to target different

              products and services differently from one another.

                    Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole
                    balance as balance increases.


                    2. Tiered

                    Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each
                    tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed
                    for that tier and not on whole balance.

                          The annual equivalent rate (AER) is interest that is
                          calculated under the assumption that any interest paid
                          is combined with the original balance and the next
                          interest payment will be based on the slightly higher
                          account balance. Overall, this means that interest can
                          be compounded several times in a year depending on the
                          number of times that interest payments are made.

              Market segmentation is a marketing term referring to the
              aggregating of prospective buyers into groups, or segments, that
              have common needs and respond similarly to a marketing action.
              Market segmentation enables companies to target different
              categories of consumers who perceive the full value of certain
              products and services differently from one another.

                    1. Banded

                    Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole
                    balance as balance increases.


                    2. Tiered

                    Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each
                    tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed
                    for that tier and not on whole balance.


                    3. Whole

                    The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the BCA
                    balance

                        description: >-
                          The annual equivalent rate (AER) is interest that is
                          calculated under the assumption that any interest paid
                          is combined with the original balance and the next
                          interest payment will be based on the slightly higher
                          account balance. Overall, this means that interest can
                          be compounded several times in a year depending on the
                          number of times that interest payments are made.
