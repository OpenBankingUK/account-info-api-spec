              Specifies the external purpose code in the format of character
              string with a maximum length of 35 characters.

              The list of valid codes is an external code list published

              Unique reference, as assigned by the creditor, to unambiguously
              refer to the payment transaction.

              Usage: If available, the initiating party should provide this
              reference in the structured remittance information, to enable
              reconciliation by the creditor upon receipt of the amount of
              money.

              If the business context requires the use of a creditor reference
              or a payment remit identification, and only one identifier can be
              passed through the end-to-end chain, the creditor's reference or
              payment remittance identification should be quoted in the
              end-to-end transaction identification.

                          Usage: The end-to-end identification can be used for
                          reconciliation or to link tasks relating to the
                          transaction. It can be included in several messages
                          related to the transaction.

                          the currency as ordered by the initiating party.

                          Usage: This amount has to be transported unchanged

                          identify the instruction.

                          Usage: the  instruction identification is a point to
                          point reference that can be used between the
                          instructing party and the instructed party to refer to

                              Usage: If available, the initiating party should
                              provide this reference in the structured
                              remittance information, to enable reconciliation

                              provide this reference in the structured
                              remittance information, to enable reconciliation

                    IntrvlMnthDay - An interval specified in months (between 01
                    to 06, 12, 24), specifying the day within the month (-5 to
                    -1, 1 to 31)

                    QtrDay - Quarterly (either ENGLISH, SCOTTISH, or RECEIVED). 

                    ENGLISH = Paid on the 25th March, 24th June, 29th September
                    and 25th December. 

                    SCOTTISH = Paid on the 2nd February, 15th May, 1st August

                    unambiguously refer to the payment transaction.

                    Usage: If available, the initiating party should provide
                    this reference in the structured remittance information, to
                    enable reconciliation by the creditor upon receipt of the
                    amount of money.

                    If the business context requires the use of a creditor
                    reference or a payment remit identification, and only one
                    identifier can be passed through the end-to-end chain, the
                    creditor's reference or payment remittance identification
                    should be quoted in the end-to-end transaction
                    identification.
