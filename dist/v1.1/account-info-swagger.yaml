                            Date and time when a transaction entry is posted to an account on the account servicer's books. Usage: Booking date is the expected booking date, unless the status is

                            All dates in the JSON payloads are represented in ISO 8601 date-time format. 

                            All date-time fields in responses must include the timezone. An example is below:

                            2017-04-05T10:43:07+00:00
                          type: string

                            Date and time at which assets become available to the account owner in case of a credit entry, or cease to be available to the account owner in case of a debit entry. 
                            Usage: If entry status is pending and value date is present, then the value date refers to an expected/requested value date. For entries subject to availability/float and
                            for which availability information is provided, the value date must not be used. In this case the availability component identifies the  number of availability days.

                            identification should be quoted in the end-to-end transaction identification.
