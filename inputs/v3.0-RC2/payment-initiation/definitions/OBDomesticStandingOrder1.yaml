    Reference:
      description: >-
        Unique reference, as assigned by the creditor, to unambiguously refer to
        the payment transaction.

        Usage: If available, the initiating party should provide this reference
        in the structured remittance information, to enable reconciliation by
        the creditor upon receipt of the amount of money.

        If the business context requires the use of a creditor reference or a
        payment remit identification, and only one identifier can be passed
        through the end-to-end chain, the creditor's reference or payment
        remittance identification should be quoted in the end-to-end transaction
        identification.
