            Market segmentation is a marketing term referring to the aggregating
            of prospective buyers into groups, or segments, that have common
            needs and respond similarly to a marketing action. Market
            segmentation enables companies to target different categories of
            consumers who perceive the full value of certain products and
            services differently from one another.

                  1. Banded

                  Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole
                  balance as balance increases.


                  2. Tiered

                  Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier
                  as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that
                  tier and not on whole balance.


                  3. Whole

                  The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the PCA
                  balance

                      description: >-
                        The annual equivalent rate (AER) is interest that is
                        calculated under the assumption that any interest paid
                        is combined with the original balance and the next
                        interest payment will be based on the slightly higher
                        account balance. Overall, this means that interest can
                        be compounded several times in a year depending on the
                        number of times that interest payments are made.
