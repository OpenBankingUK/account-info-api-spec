        Usage: Booking date is the expected booking date, unless the status is

        All dates in the JSON payloads are represented in ISO 8601 date-time
        format. 

        All date-time fields in responses must include the timezone. An example
        is below:

        2017-04-05T10:43:07+00:00

        Usage: If transaction entry status is pending and value date is present,
        then the value date refers to an expected/requested value date.

        For transaction entries subject to availability/float and for which
        availability information is provided, the value date must not be used.
        In this case the availability component identifies the number of
        availability days.
