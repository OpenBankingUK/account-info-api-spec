    BookingDateTime:
      description: >-
        Date and time when a transaction entry is posted to an account on the
        account servicer's books.

        Usage: Booking date is the expected booking date, unless the status is
        booked, in which case it is the actual booking date.

        All dates in the JSON payloads are represented in ISO 8601 date-time
        format. 

        All date-time fields in responses must include the timezone. An example
        is below:

        2017-04-05T10:43:07+00:00
      type: string
      format: date-time
    ValueDateTime:
      description: >-
        Date and time at which assets become available to the account owner in
        case of a credit entry, or cease to be available to the account owner in
        case of a debit transaction entry.

        Usage: If transaction entry status is pending and value date is present,
        then the value date refers to an expected/requested value date.

        For transaction entries subject to availability/float and for which
        availability information is provided, the value date must not be used.
        In this case the availability component identifies the number of
        availability days.
